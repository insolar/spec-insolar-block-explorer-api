    # Insolar Explorer API documentation

    Welcome to Insolar documentation for a REST-like API provided by Insolar Explorer.

    [Insolar Explorer](https://github.com/insolar/block-explorer) is a service for searching for and viewing the contents of individual transactions, records, lifelines, jet drops and jets.

    The API allows to search for, filter and view the contents of said entities.

    ## Entities description

    * Record—minimum unit of storage that contains an associated request, response, and service information.
    * Lifeline—sequence of records. A record in a lifeline is an object state and an object is a smart contract instance.
    * Jet drop—unit of storage for jets.
    * Jet—group of lifelines.

    * Jet drop ID—combination of jet id and pulse number.
    * Index—combination of pulse number and order (record number in a jet drop).


    ## Filtering, pagination, sorting

    Some requests have filtering, sorting, and pagination capabilities.

    ### Filtering

    Filtering can be of two types:
    * By an attribute value: filters out from the returned array all the entities with attribute values other than specified.

      For example: if you specify `type=request` in a [request](#operation/jet_drop_records) that returns an array of records of different types, the array doesn't contain the `result` and `state` records.

    * By a range of attribute values: filters out from the returned array entities with attribute values that are out of the specified range.

      You can specify inclusive, non-inclusive, open-ended, or closed-ended ranges depending on the request.

      All range filter parameters have one the following suffixes:
      * `*_gt`—greater than
      * `*_lt`—less than
      * `*_gte`—greater than or equal to
      * `*_lte`—less than or equal to

      For example: if you specify `timestamp_gte=1597409219` and `timestamp_lte=1597409241` in a [request](#operation/pulses) that returns an array of pulses, the array doesn't contain pulses older than `51063280` and younger than `51063340`.

    ### Sorting

    The returned array is sorted by an attribute with a monotonically increasing value (`pulse_number`, `index`), by default in the descending order. Sorting is applied after filtering, if any.

    For example: if you specify `sort_by=index_asc` in a [request](#operation/object_lifeline) that returns an array of records, the array is sorted in the ascending order of `index`.

    ### Pagination

    Pagination can be applied after filtering and sorting, and uses the following 3 parameters:

    * `limit`—number of array items to return.
    * `offset`—number of items to skip.
    * `from_*`—pagination starting point: the value of a monotonically increasing attribute.

  - name: Pulse
    description: Pulse is the trigger for the production of a new jet drop. Pulse also serves as the default time unit on Insolar Network.
  - name: Jet drop
    description: Jet drop is the unit of storage for jets. Jet drop contains all records that are registered within a pulse and associated with a particular jet.
  - name: Record
    description: Record is the minimum unit of storage that contains an associated request, response, and service information. Records are grouped by lifeline.
