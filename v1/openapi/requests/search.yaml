  description: |
    Searches for an entity by its identifier.

    Entities and their identifiers may be one of the following:
    * Record—record reference
    * Jet drop—jet drop ID (combination of `jet_id` and `pulse_number`)
    * Pulse—pulse number
    * Lifelife—object reference

    Search takes any of the identifiers above as the `value` parameter, determines the identifier type and finds the corresponding entity. If the entity exists, search returns its type and meta-information.
