    # Insolar Explorer API documentation


    Welcome to Insolar documentation for a REST-like API provided by Insolar
    Explorer.


    [Insolar Explorer](https://github.com/insolar/block-explorer) is a service
    for searching for and viewing the contents of records, lifelines, jet drops,
    and jets.


    Insolar Explorer provides an API that allows to search for said entities as
    well as request, filter, sort, and paginate their arrays.


    ## Entities description


    Basic Insolar entities that you can find in this specification are the
    following:


    * Record—minimum unit of storage that contains an associated request,
    response, and service information.
      Records can be of three types:
      * Request. Most requests are caused by other requests inside the Plaftorm with the exception of original requests. The latter are invoked by users.
      * Result. Each request has a corresponding execution result.
      * State. Some execution results change object state. They are caused by so-called mutable requests, while immutable requests are simple read operations.
    * Lifeline — sequence of records. A record in a lifeline is an object state
    and an object is a smart contract instance.

    * Jet drop — unit of storage for jets.

    * Jet — group of lifelines.

    * Original-Request -  it is request from outside

    * Request - it is request inside the platform


    Some of the entities have complex identifiers. For example:


    * A jet drop ID is a combination of jet ID and pulse number.

    * A record's index is a combination of pulse number and order.

    * An order is a record number in a jet drop.


    ## Filtering, pagination, sorting


    Some requests have filtering, sorting, and pagination capabilities.


    ### Filtering


    Filtering can be of two types:

    * By an attribute value: filters out from the returned array all the
    entities with attribute values other than specified.

      For example: if you specify `type=request` in a [request](#operation/jet_drop_records) that returns an array of records of different types, the array doesn't contain the `result` and `state` records.

    * By a range of attribute values: filters out from the returned array
    entities with attribute values that are out of the specified range.

      You can specify inclusive, non-inclusive, open-ended, or closed-ended ranges depending on the request.

      All range filter parameters have one of the following suffixes:
      * `*_gt`—greater than
      * `*_lt`—less than
      * `*_gte`—greater than or equal to
      * `*_lte`—less than or equal to

      For example: if you specify `timestamp_gte=1597409219` and `timestamp_lte=1597409241` in a [request](#operation/pulses) that returns an array of pulses, the array doesn't contain pulses older than `51063280` and younger than `51063340`.

    ### Sorting


    The returned array is sorted by an attribute with a monotonically increasing
    value (`pulse_number`, `index`), by default in the descending order. Sorting
    is applied after filtering, if any.


    For example: if you specify `sort_by=index_asc` in a
    [request](#operation/object_lifeline) that returns an array of records, the
    array is sorted in the ascending order of `index`.


    ### Pagination


    Pagination can be applied after filtering and sorting, and uses the
    following 3 parameters:


    * `limit`—number of array items to return.

    * `offset`—number of items to skip.

    * `from_*`—pagination starting point: the value of a monotonically
    increasing attribute. The `*` designates the property name to paginate by.


    For example: if you specify `?limit=100&offset=5&from_index=47382564:2` in a
    [request](#operation/jet_drop_records) that returns an array of records, the
    array:


    * Starts with a record with the 5th index relative to the index
    `47382564:2`.

    * Can consist of 100 entries maximum.


    The number of entries may vary depending on the actual number of records
    requested.

    To show if the value of the `limit` parameter is higher or lower than the
    actual number of entries, each response to a paginated request contains the
    actual existing number in the `total` property.

      Pairs of requests and results.


      Request can either be an original request a user made via the API or a
      subsequent request one object made to another.

      Except the original, requests have a reason, which is a reference to the
      previous one.

      The reason of original request is not pointer but a reference that is
      formed from the pulse data and the request's parameters.


      Each result contains a reference to the corresponding request.

        Entities and their identifiers may be one of the following:

        * State-state by object

        * Jet drop—jet drop ID (combination of `jet_id` and `pulse_number`)

        * Pulse—pulse number

        * Lifeline—object reference

        * Original request—user request that comes from outside the Platform

        * Request—request one object made to another inside the Platform


        Search takes any of the identifiers above as the `value` parameter,
        determines the identifier type and finds the corresponding entity. If
        the entity exists, search returns its type and meta-information.
